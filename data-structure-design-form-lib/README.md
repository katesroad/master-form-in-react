# README

- Idea from [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-for-busy-developers-learn-by-doing-ecommerce/learn/lecture/24042332#reviews)
- Main idea:
  - design structure for form, including
    - dirty
    - valid
    - errors
    - controls
  - behavior analysis for form validation
  - behavior with raw html input
    - checkbox
    - radio
    - text
    - number
- Codebase: [src/Registration.jsx](./src/Registration.jsx)
- Questions:
  - It seems like the dirty field is unnecessary
